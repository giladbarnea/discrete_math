    Find the power of each of the following sets



    ‫א‬
        The set of all real numbers A⊆(0,1) that when expanded as
        an infinite fraction, each digit appears adjacent to an
        equal digit.

    First, A⊆(0,1) ⟹ |A|≤|(0,1)|.

    On the other hand, function 𝒇:(0,1)→A, e.g: 𝒇(0.a 1 a 2 ...) =
    0.a 1 a 1 a 2 a 2 ... is one-to-one, therefore:

    |(0,1)|≤|A|

    Considering Cantor-Bernstein: |(0,1)|≤|A| ⟹ |(0,1)| = |A| = ℵ



    ‫ב‬
        ((ℕ)×(0,1)) ∩ (ℝ×ℚ)

    The intersection means that:
    ⟨x,y⟩∈((ℕ)×(0,1)) ∩ (ℝ×ℚ) ⟺ ⟨x,y⟩∈((ℕ)×(0,1)) ∧ ⟨x,y⟩∈(ℝ×ℚ)

    Expanding the pairs:
    y∈(0,1) ∧ x∈ℕ ∧ y∈ℚ ∧ x∈ℝ ⟹ x∈ℕ∩ℝ = ℕ ∧ y∈(0,1)∩ℚ

    Therefore:
    ℕ×((0,1)∩ℚ) = (ℕ×(0,1))∩(ℝ×ℚ)

    Since (0,1)∩ℚ ⊆ Q ⟹ |(0,1)∩ℚ|≤|ℚ|=ℵ 0

    On the other hand,

    { 1 / 1 , 1 / 2 , 1 / 3 , ...} ⊆ (0,1)∩ℚ ⟹ ℵ 0 = |{ 1 / 1 , 1 / 2 , 1 / 3 , ...}| ≤ |
    (0,1)∩ℚ|

    From Cantor-Bernstein: |(0,1)∩ℚ|=ℵ 0

    Since:
    - A×A is countable if A is countable
    - |A|=ℵ 0 if A is countable and infinite
    - A×A is equivalent to A if A is countable and infinite

    ⟹

    |ℕ×((0,1)∩ℚ)|=ℵ 0

    Finally:

    |(ℕ×(0,1)∩(ℝ×ℚ))|=ℵ 0



    ‫ג‬
        𝓟((0,1)\𝑰) where 𝑰 is the set of all real, irrational
        numbers (I think it's marked 𝕁?)

    (0,1)\𝑰 is the set of all rational numbers contained in the
    interval (0,1).

    So (0,1)\𝑰 = (0,1)∩ℚ ⟹ |(0,1)\𝑰|=ℵ 0 ⟹ |(0,1)\𝑰|=ℵ 0 .

    Since:
    - given |A|=ℵ 0 , then 𝓟(A) is not countable and 𝓟(A) ~ {0,1} A
    - if n is a positive natural number, then {0,1,...,n} ℕ ~ ℝ, so |
    {0,1,...,n} ℕ | = ℵ

    ⟹

    𝓟((0,1)\𝑰) ~ {0,1} (0,1)\𝑰 ⟹ |𝓟((0,1)\𝑰)|=ℵ



    ‫ד‬
        𝓟((0,10 −10 )\ℚ)

    The power of (0,10 −10 ):

    Since every non-degenerate interval is equivalent to ℝ, ⟹
    (0,10 −10 ) ~ ℝ ⟹ |(0,10 −10 )|=ℵ.

    The power of (0,10 −10 )\ℚ:

    We know that for any two sets A and B:
    given B⊆A and |B|=ℵ 0 , the two sets satisfy |A\B|=|A| if A\B is
    infinite or A is non-countable (either is sufficient).

    Let A=(0,10 −10 ); B=(0,10 −10 )∩ℚ. It follows that B⊆A and |B|=ℵ 0 ,
    therefore |A\B|=|A|.

    Since |A|=ℵ and A\B=(0,10 −10 )\ℚ ⟹ |(0,10 −10 )\ℚ|=ℵ.

                                                                                  -10 )\Q|
    Because |𝓟(A)|=2 |A| ⟹ |𝓟((0,10 −10 )\ℚ)| = 2 |(0,10                                     =2 ℵ

        Let:
        M = {A∈𝓟(ℕ) | |A|=ℵ 0 ∧ |A|=ℵ 0 }
        K = {A∈𝓟(ℕ) | |A|=ℵ 0 }

        Prove or disprove the following:



    ‫א‬
        |K|=ℵ 0

    The statement is false.

    Let X be the set of all odd, natural numbers. It follows that for
    every set Y that satisfies Y⊆X, the following holds: X⊆Y.

    Y⊆ℕ and is infinite ⟹ |Y|=ℵ 0 ⟹ every subset of X belongs to K.

    Therefore 𝓟(X)⊆K ⇒ |𝓟(X)|≤|K|.

    Since |X|=ℵ 0 ⟹ |𝓟(X)| = 2 |X| = 2 ℵ 0 , therefore 2 ℵ 0 ≤|K| ⟹ |K|≠ℵ 0



    ‫ב‬
        |M|=ℵ 0

    The statement is false.

    Let:
    X be the set of all odd, natural numbers
    Y = {4n+2 | n∈ℕ}
    Z is a set that satisfies Y≤Z≤X (and so is infinite and contained
    in ℕ)

    It follows that |Z|=ℵ 0 and that |Z|=ℵ 0 ⟹ Z∈M ⟹ {Z∈𝓟(ℕ) |
    Y⊆Z⊆X}⊆M.

    For convenience, let Q={Z∈𝓟(ℕ) | Y⊆Z⊆X}.

    Let's define function 𝒇 from Q to 𝓟(X\Y), defined by 𝒇(B)=B\F. 𝒇
    is onto and one-to-one ⟹ Q ~ 𝓟(X\Y).

    Since X\Y={4n | n∈ℕ} ⟹ |X\Y|=ℵ 0 , therefore |𝓟(X\Y)|=2 ℵ 0 =ℵ ⟹
    |Q|=ℵ.

    Q is contained in M therefore |M|≥ℵ therefore |M|≠ℵ 0

    ‫ג‬
        |𝓟(ℕ)\K|=ℵ 0

    The statement is true.

    K is the set of all sets partial to ℕ whose complement is
    infinite, therefore 𝓟(ℕ)\K is the set of all set partial to ℕ
    whose complement is finite.

    Let X(ℕ) be the set of all finite sets that are partial to ℕ. In
    other words, the union of all finite sets of natural numbers.

    A finite set S of natural numbers is countable, because S is
    contained in a set of natural numbers ranging from ∅ to n, where
    n if the greatest element in S.

    Therefore X(ℕ) consist of a countable number of countable sets ⟹
    X(ℕ) itself is countable.

    Moreover, X(ℕ) is infinite ⟹ |X(ℕ)|=ℵ 0 .                             (0)

    Let's define function 𝒇 from 𝓟(ℕ)\K to X(ℕ), defined by 𝒇(A)=A. 𝒇
    is onto and one-to-one ⟹ |𝓟(ℕ)\K| = |X(ℕ)|.     (1)

    Combining (0) and (1), we get |𝓟(ℕ)\K|=ℵ 0



    ‫ד‬
        |𝓟(ℕ)\M|=ℵ 0

    The statement is true.

    Based on the definition of M:
    𝓟(ℕ)\M is the set of all sets partial to ℕ which are finite or
    that their complement is finite.

    Let X = {A∈𝓟(ℕ) | |A|=ℵ 0 } ⟹
    𝓟(ℕ)\X is the set of all finite sets partial to ℕ ⟹
    𝓟(ℕ)\M = (𝓟(ℕ)\K)∪(𝓟(ℕ)\X).

    Because 𝓟(ℕ)\X is the same as X(ℕ) from gimel, |𝓟(ℕ)\X|=ℵ 0 .
    Considering the conclusion of gimel (|𝓟(ℕ)\K|=ℵ 0 ), and given that
    the union of sets with cardinality of ℵ 0 has itself a cardinality
    of ℵ 0 ⟹ |𝓟(ℕ)\M|=ℵ 0 .

        Let:
        A = {A 𝑖 | 𝑖∈ℕ} where A 𝑖 ⊆ℕ, A 𝑖 ≠A 𝑗 , A 𝑖 ∩A 𝑗 =∅, for all 𝑖,𝑗∈ℕ, 𝑖≠𝑗

        B is a set of non-empty, open intervals in ℝ such that no
        two intervals overlap
        C is an uncountable, infinite set of open intervals in ℝ.

        Prove:



    ‫א‬
        |B|≤|A|

    First let's prove that |A|=ℵ 0 .

    Function 𝒇:ℕ→A defined by 𝒇(𝑖)=A 𝑖 for all 𝑖∈ℕ is onto.
    Also, because 𝑖,𝑗∈ℕ and 𝑖≠𝑗, the following holds: A 𝑖 ≠A 𝑗 ⟹ 𝒇(𝑖)≠𝒇(𝑗)
    ⟹ A~ℕ ⟹ |A|=ℵ 0 .

    Let B={B 𝛼 | 𝛼∈I} where I is a matching set of indices.
    Let 𝒇 be a function from I→B defined by 𝒇(𝛼)=B 𝛼 for all 𝛼∈I.
    𝒇 is one-to-one and onto ⟹ |B|=|I|.

    Because every non-empty open interval contains all rational
    numbers, and because for all 𝛼∈I, set B 𝛼 is a non-empty open
    interval ⟹ for all 𝛼∈I there exists a number q 𝛼 ∈ℚ such that
    q 𝛼 ∈B 𝛼 .

    Let 𝒈 be a function from I→ℚ defined by 𝒇(𝛼)=q 𝛼 for all 𝛼∈I.
    To prove (by negation) that 𝒈 is one-to-one, let's assume that
    𝒇(𝛼)=𝒇(𝛽) for 𝛼,b∈I where 𝛼≠𝛽 ⟹ q 𝛼 = q 𝛽 .
    q 𝛼 ∈B 𝛼 and q 𝛽 ∈B 𝛽 ⟹ q 𝛼 ∈(B 𝛼 ∩B 𝛽 ) which negates the definition of B
    (no two intervals in B overlap).

    Having concluded that 𝒈 is one-to-one ⟹ |I|≤|ℚ|=ℵ 0 ⟹ |B|≤ℵ 0 ⟹
    |B|≤|A|.



    ‫ב‬
        Prove that two intervals I,J∈C exist such that |I∩J|=|ℝ|

    We have concluded in alef that if two intervals are don't
    overlap, then their set is countable.

    Combining the definition of C together with the aforementioned
    conclusion, it follows that there exist I,J∈C such that I∩J≠∅.

    Let I=(a,b); J=(c,d). Assuming a≤c, since I∩J≠∅ ⟹ c                                ﹤b   ⟹ I∩J=
    (c,b).

    We know that every non-degenerate is equivalent to ℝ, therefore
    |I∩J|=|(b,c)|=|ℝ|.
