𝑹 2 : a𝑹 2 c ⟺ {⟨a,c⟩ | ∃b ∈ A (⟨a,b⟩ ∈ 𝑹 ∧ ⟨b,c⟩ ∈ 𝑹)}

an ordered pair ⟨a,c⟩∈𝑹 2 means there's a "middle" b∈B that
satisfies ⟨a,b⟩∈𝑹 ∧ ⟨b,c⟩∈𝑹
Examples
 • (a=−b) 2 = 𝑰
                ℝ
 • ⟨a,b⟩ ∈ 𝑹 2 ⟺ ⟨a,c⟩,⟨c,b⟩ ∈ 𝑹

Empty ∅ A

𝑹:=rel(A×B) = ∅
No pair ∈ A×B satisfies ⟨a,b⟩ ∈ 𝑹
Properties
 • 𝑺·∅ A = ∅
 • anti−symmetric
 • symmetric ?
Examples
 • {⟨x,y⟩ ∈ ℕ 2 | x+y﹤x}

Identity 𝑰 A

Properties
 • 𝑹·𝑰 A = 𝑹

Reflexivity
𝑹:=rel(A) is reflexive if ∀a ∈ A(⟨a,a⟩ ∈ 𝑹)
𝑹 is reflexive if every a ∈ A satisfies ⟨a,a⟩∈𝑹. In other
words:
𝑰A ⊆ 𝑹
A = { −1, 0, 1 }. Is ⋱ contained ∈ 𝑹?
𝑹 = lambda a,b: a⊙b; all(R(x,x) for x ∈ A)?
Properties
 • ⟺ 𝑹 −1 is reflexive
 • → 𝑹 ⊆ 𝑹 2 (and 𝑹 2 is reflexive)
 • → 𝑹⊆𝑹 2
 • if 𝑺⊆𝑹 then 𝑺 is reflexive
 • if 𝑺 is reflexive then both 𝑹∪𝑺 ∧ 𝑹∩𝑺 are reflexive
Examples
 • 𝑼 A : ∀a ∈ A(⟨a,a⟩ ∈ A×A = 𝑼A)
 • 𝑰 A : ∀a ∈ A(⟨a,a⟩ ∈ {⟨−1, −1⟩, ⟨0, 0⟩, ⟨1, 1⟩})
 • ≤, ≥        both contain ⋱
Counter Examples
 • ≠ (which is 𝑼 A − 𝑰A)
 • <, >, ∅ A
 • a=−b ⋰

Anti-Reflexivity
𝑹:=rel(A) is anti−reflexive iff ¬∃a ∈ A(⟨a,a⟩ ∈ 𝑹)
𝑹 is reflexive if every a ∈ A satisfies ⟨a,a⟩ ∉ 𝑹. In other
words:
𝑰A ∩ 𝑹 = ∅
   just 𝑰 A ⊈ 𝑹 isn't enough; 𝑰 A = {⟨1,1⟩, ⟨2,2⟩} ⊈ 𝑹 = {⟨1,1⟩,
⟨1,2⟩} but ⟨1,1⟩ ∈ 𝑹 so isn't anti−reflexive
Examples
 • ≠, <, >, ∅ A

Counter Examples
 • 𝑼 A , 𝑰 A , a=−b ⋰, ≤, ≥

Symmetry

𝑹:=rel(A) is symmetric iff 𝑹 = 𝑹 −1
𝑹 is symmetric if every ⟨x,y⟩ ∈ 𝑹 satisfies ⟨y,x⟩ ∈ 𝑹
   assuming both x ∧ y exist ∈ A
∀x∀y(⟨x,y⟩∈𝑹 → ⟨y,x⟩∈𝑹)
𝑹 = lambda a,b: a⊙b; all(rel(y,x) for x,y ∈ R)?
Properties
 • if 𝑺 is symmetric then both 𝑹∪𝑺 ∧ 𝑹∩𝑺 are reflexive
 • if 𝑺 is symmetric then 𝑹\𝑺 is symmetric
Examples
 • ∅         can't point at ⟨x,y⟩ ∧ say ⟨y,x⟩ is ¬ ∈ ∅ −1
     A
  • 𝑼 A , 𝑰 A , a=−b ⋰, ≠

Counter Examples
  • ≤, ≥, <, >

Anti-Symmetry

𝑹:=rel(A) is anti−symmetric iff 𝑹 ∩ 𝑹 −1 = ∅
𝑹 is anti−symmetric if every ⟨x,y⟩ ∈ 𝑹 satisfies ⟨y,x⟩ ∉ 𝑹
∀x∀y((x,y) ∈ 𝑹 → (y,x) ∉ 𝑹)

𝑹 ∩ 𝑹 −1 = ∅ means there can't be a ⟨x,x⟩
Properties
  • → 𝑹 is anti−reflexive
  • → 𝑹 −1 is anti−symmetric
  • if 𝑺⊆𝑹 then 𝑺 is anti−symmetric
  • if 𝑺∪𝑻 is anti−symmetric then both 𝑺 ∧ 𝑻 are
    anti−symmetric
  • → 𝑹∩𝑺 is anti−symmetric
  • if 𝑹 is antireflexive ∧ transitive then it's asymmetric
    ∧ anti−symmetric
Examples
  • <, >, ∅ A
  • b﹥a 2

Counter Examples
  • ≠, ≤, ≥, 𝑼 A , 𝑰 A , a=−b ⋰, ≠
  • b﹤a 2        ⟨3,4⟩ ∧ ⟨4,3⟩ are symmetric

Weak Anti-Symmetry

𝑹 ∩ 𝑹 −1 ⊆ 𝑰 A

∀x∀y(⟨x,y⟩ ∈ 𝑹 ∧ ⟨y,x⟩ ∈ 𝑹 → x=y)
if both ⟨x,y⟩ ∈ 𝑹 ∧ ⟨y,x⟩ ∈ 𝑹 it's only because they're
equal
for x,y ∈ A: if x≠y ∧ ⟨x,y⟩ ∈ 𝑹 then must ⟨y,x⟩ ∉ 𝑹
A S vs WA S : A S requires every pair's opposite to ¬ be ∈ 𝑹,
whereas WA S requires the same only for pairs that x=y

Examples
  • 𝑰A
Transitivity

𝑹2 ⊆ 𝑹
∀x∀y∀z((𝑹(x,y) ∧ 𝑹(y,z)) → 𝑹(x,z))
Every (x,y,z)∈A that satisfy ⟨x,y⟩∈𝑹 ∧ ⟨y,z⟩∈𝑹 also satisfy
⟨x,z⟩∈𝑹
If you see an x that leads to y that leads to z, then expect
x to lead to z       this is why 𝑹 2 ⊆ 𝑹
Properties
 • if 𝑻 is symmetric ∧ anti−symmetric then it's also
   transitive
Examples
 • A={1,2,3}; 𝑹 = {⟨1,2⟩, ⟨2,3⟩, ⟨1,3⟩} ⇒ 𝑹 2 = {⟨1,3⟩} ⊆ 𝑹
 • A={1,2,3}; 𝑻 = {⟨1,2⟩} ⇒ 𝑻 2 = ∅ ⊆ 𝑻
 • 𝑾 = {⟨1,1⟩} ⇒ 𝑾 2 = {⟨1,1⟩} ⊆ 𝑾
 • 𝑰A
 • ∅A
 • 𝑼         if ⟨a,b⟩ ∈ A 2 ∧ ⟨b,a⟩ ∈ A 2 then ⟨a,c⟩ ∈ A 2
     A
 • if |A|﹥1 then ≠ is trans
 • <, ≤
Counter Examples
 • 𝑷={⟨1,2⟩, ⟨2,1⟩} ⇒ 𝑷 2 = {⟨1,1⟩, ⟨2,2⟩} ⊈ 𝑷
      iow: 1 leads to 2 leads to 1, but ⟨1,1⟩ ⊈ 𝑷
 • ∃x∃y∃z(𝑹(x,y) ∧ 𝑹(y,z) ∧ ¬𝑹(x,z))


Equivalance
𝑹 over A is equivalence iff 𝑹 is reflexive, symmetric ∧
transitive
Examples
 • 𝑼 A , 𝑰 A , equality
 • "Has the same absolute value" on the set of real numbers
 • if A=∅ then ∅ A is symmetric, transitive ∧ reflexive

Counter Examples

 • if A≠∅ then ∅ A is symmetric ∧ transitive, but ¬
   reflexive
Connexivity

∈𝑹)



Order
lesson 7 00:00:00

Partial Order
𝑹 over A (≤) is a partial order iff it's antireflexive ∧
transitive
Properties
 • Antisymmetric      because antireflexive ∧ transitive
Examples
 • ⊂ over 𝓟(A)
???
for all a, b, ∧ c:
 • a ≤ a    reflex
 • if a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ a, then a = b      antisymm
 • if a ≤ b ∧ b ≤ c, then a ≤ c      trans
Examples
 • equality
   ???

Total Order
Partial order ∧ connexive (aka "linearly ordered")
∀(x,y)∈A (x≠y → ⟨x,y⟩∈𝑹 ⊻ ⟨y,x⟩∈𝑹)     note the xor. verify
Examples
 • ⊂ over ℕ      also over ℝ?
Counter Examples
 • if A≠∅ then 𝑰 A isn't total order because for all a∈A:
   a=a
Partitions
Partition of A is a set of non−empty, non−overlapping
subsets of A whose ∪ = A
Properties
 •   every a∈A is ∈ exactly one block
 •   no block contains ∅
 •   ∪ of blocks = A
 •   ∩ of any two blocks = ∅
 •   → A is finite ⇒ rank of P is |X| − |P| ?
Examples
 • {A} is partition of A    trivial
 • ∅'s only partition is ∅
 • {1,2,3} has five partitions: {{1},{2},{3}}, {{1, 2},
   {3}}, {{1, 3},{2}}, {{1},{2, 3}}, {{1, 2, 3}}
Counter Examples
 • ¬ partitions of {1,2,3}:
      ◦ {{}, {1,3}, {2}}    contains ∅
      ◦ {{1, 2}, {2, 3}}    2 exists ∈ more than one block
      ◦ {{1}, {2}}    no block contains 3


Equivalence Class: {x∈𝑺 | x≡a} where a∈𝑺
Given 𝑹 is an equivalence relation on 𝑺, the equivalence
class of an element a ∈ 𝑺 is the set {x∈𝑺 | ⟨x,a⟩∈𝑹}
⟦a⟧ = {b|a𝑹b} = {b|⟨a,b⟩ ∈ 𝑹}     all elements ∈ 𝑺 that when
paired with a, exist ∈ 𝑹
In other words: going over 𝑹, the elements ∈ ⟦a⟧ are all the
elements that a is paired with
Properties
 • ⋃ of all equivalence classes = 𝑺 ?
 • a ∈ ⟦a⟧    every element exists ∈ its equivalence class
 • the items ∈ each equivalence class of 𝑺 exist only ∈
   their equivalence class ?
 • every possible pair of eq. classes is zar ?
Examples
 • 𝑿 = all cars; relation ≡ 𝑿 = "has the same color as"; one
   particular equivlance class consists of all green cars
 • Relation ≡ ℤ is ⟨a,b⟩∈≡ ℤ ⟺ (a − b)%2==∅ ⟹ two equivalence
     classes: even numbers ∧ odd numbers
• 𝑺 = {1,2,3,4,5}
   ◦ ≡ 𝑺 = {⟨1,1⟩, ⟨1,2⟩, ⟨1,3⟩, ⟨2,2⟩, ⟨3,3⟩, ⟨4,4⟩,
     ⟨5,5⟩, ⟨2,1⟩, ⟨2,3⟩, ⟨3,2⟩, ⟨3,1⟩}
   ◦ ⟦1⟧ = {1, 2, 3}     everything that 1 is related to
   ◦ ⟦2⟧ = {2, 1, 3}
   ◦ ⟦3⟧ = {3, 2, 1}     note that ⟦1⟧ ≡ ⟦2⟧ ≡ ⟦3⟧
   ◦ ⟦4⟧ = {4}
   ◦ ⟦5⟧ = {5}
